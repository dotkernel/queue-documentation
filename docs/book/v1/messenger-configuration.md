## Main queue stream (`messages`)

`messages` stream is the main queue where all new messages are initially stored. The Messenger worker consume messages from this stream and attempt to process them according to the application logic.

## Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

DLQ is a dedicated transport where messages are sent when they fail to be processed after a configured number of retries. Each transport can define a retry_strategy specifying the maximum number of retry attempts, delays between retries, and exponential backoff rules. When a message exceeds the allowed retries, it is automatically forwarded to the failure transport and stored in `failed` stream, ensuring that failed messages do not block the queue.
